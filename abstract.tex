Software defined networking (SDN) enables unified control over heterogeneous network switches by separating the control plane from the data plane.
Therefore by design, the controller have high-level overview over its network and control the flows in its domain.
This feature allows better security mechanism compared to the traditional networking since the traditional method do not have the global knowledge about its local area.
However, the traditional method of deploying deploying firewall does not utilize the advantages brought forth by the SDN.
Therefore in this paper, I will survey a facet of security concerns and proposed solutions regarding the SDN: the firewall.
The survey will categorize the existing proposed solutions and their capabilities.
